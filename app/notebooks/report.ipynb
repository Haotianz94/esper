    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the news, everyone's got an opinion, but conversely, everyone also has an opinion about the news. This channel is biased, that show only talks about negative news, the whole media covers too much Trump. Opinions are easy to make based on the individuals shows and clips we watch or see shared on social media every day. Now more than ever, it's critical that our understanding of how we produce and consume news media is informed by data, not anecdotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, advances in artificial intelligence and big data systems are now enabling us to analyze complex visual mediums like video at scale. Computer vision and machine learning technologies can automatically watch video to find and recognize individuals, identify visual attributes like clothing, lighting, and setting, as well as break video into segments, e.g. commercials vs. news. Cloud infrastructure combined with big data systems can enable individuals to scale these technologies to automatically annotate thousands or millions of hours of video.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of these two trends, we  conducted a study to analyze 70,000 hours of US TV news video over three years provided by the Internet Archive. We sought to identify trends in screen time, speaking time, topic coverage, and more. Our dataset consisted of every video broadcast by CNN, FOX, and MSNBC from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 and included the video, audio, and closed captions. Methodology for each analysis is provided at the end of this report."

We would like to know who is being provided the platform to share their views, along with when/where that occurs, starting with analyzing men vs. women. We looked at two metrics: screen time, or the length of time a person is on screen, and speaking time, or how long a person is talking. For example, if two men and one woman are on screen for 5 seconds with the woman speaking, this would be 10 seconds of male screen time, 5 seconds of female screen time, and 5 seconds of female speaking time.

    "To classify a person as the host or non-host, we start by computing the a 128-dimensional feature-space embedding of each face using the [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) network, and cluster the faces within each video using a standard k-means algorithm. Using the hypothesis that a host is uniquely likely to appear frequently throughout the show, we identify face clusters as hosts if faces in the cluster are widely spread in time.\n",

    "To classify the clothing hosts wear into categories, we used a modified version of the [StreetStyle](http://streetstyle.cs.cornell.edu/) clothing classifier trained on the StreetStyle-27k dataset as well as a hand-labeled set of 5000 randomly sampled images of hosts from TV news. We also add necktie color/pattern and hair color/length as attributes (not present in the prior StreetStyle classifier). Classifier accuracies on the TV news host validation set are below."
