    "# Querying for Interviews with Person X\n",

    "We have an annotated sandbox of panels, interviews, and commercials (`query_labeledpanel`, `query_labeledinterview`, `query_commercial`). In this notebook we'll try to use write queries for these concepts and compare the results against our labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes about the panels:\n",
    "* Panel segments go from the introduction of panelists to the shot where the host says \"thank you\" or \"goodbye\" to the panelists. Sometimes the camera will cut wide and show all the panelists before a commercial break; such shots are *not* included in the labeled segments.\n",
    "* Panel segments are split up by commercials (i.e., if the same panel appears before and after a commercial break, that will be two panel segments).\n",
    "* Panels segments do not include segments where the host is just cutting to multiple reporters out in the field to cover some news story.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes about the interviews. See the third bullet point in particular.\n",
    "* Interview segments go from the first shot of the guest to where the host thanks the guest. Sometimes the host thanks the guest while the guest is on screen, and sometimes the host thanks the guest off-screen. In the former case, the segment continues until the guest is no longer on screen; in the latter case, the segment stops when the host changes the subject after thanking the guest.\n",
    "* Sometimes the host doesn't thank the guest; in this case, the segment ends when the guest is no longer on screen or when the host changes the subject.\n",
    "* **Interviews with analysts and correspondents from the same network are *not* included. This is to differentiate between the typical interview and \"interviews\" where the guest is just presenting a news segment.**\n",
    "* Interviews with reporters from the same network are also usually not included, *unless* the format of the interview is sufficiently different from the typical \"here's a reporter to tell you the news\" format. This is a judgment call on my (Dan Fu) part.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset also includes extra annotation of interviews with Kellyanne Conway, Bernie Sanders, and John McCain.\n",
    "* These interview segments include **any** segment where Kellyanne Conway, Bernie Sanders, or John McCain appear and are being interviewed. This includes segments during commercials or short clips where an interview of one of them is being played on another channel or show.\n",
    "* These segments also include clips where the guest appears for a few seconds as a \"preview\" before a commercial break.\n",
    "* Each of these segments is annotated with the name of the guest(s) and interviewer(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes about the commercials.\n",
    "* Commercial segments go from the beginning of the commercial break to the end of the commercial break. Sometimes networks will put in a segment from the network to let the viewers know that the commercial break is ending (think \"this is CNN, the must trusted name in news\" segment). Such segments are included in the commercial segments."

The main reason is that there are very few interviews of John McCain, so any false positives (there is one) throw the precision numbers quite off. There's also a big false negative for John McCain - an interview with Jake Tapper that was played verbatim on CNN, but not on Jake Tapper's show. This false negative occurs because Jake Tapper's face wasn't registered as a host during that playtime."
